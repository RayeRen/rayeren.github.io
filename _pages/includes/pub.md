- Due to the large scale and illumination difference between aerial and satellite images, it is challenging that most existing cross-view image matching algorithms fail to localize the UAV images robustly and accurately. To solve the above problem, a novel UAV localization framework containing three-stage coarse-to-fine image matching is proposed.
- The experimental results illustrate that for more than 80% of the testing pair images, the proposed method is capable of refining the positioning error within 5 pixels, which meets the needs of UAV localization and is superior to other popular methods.
