- Due to the large scale and illumination difference between aerial and satellite images, it is challenging that most existing cross-view image matching algorithms fail to localize the UAV images robustly and accurately. To solve the above problem, a novel UAV localization framework containing three-stage coarse-to-fine image matching is proposed.
