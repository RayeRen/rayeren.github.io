I am a graduate student in Oxford University. 

I am now working on speech enhancement, sound generation and AI in healthcare research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [Yunjia.Qi21@student.xjtlu.edu.cn](mailto:Yunjia.Qi21@student.xjtlu.edu.cn). We are hiring interns!

I graduated from [School of Advanced Technology](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology/), Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University with a bachelor's degree and will be pursuing my master's degree at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.
